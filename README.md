# jinkies-REST-API
A REST API is based on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) behaviour. It can be applied to a unique resource.
REST APIs generally don't function (well) without being pointed to a direct resource.
REST conventions work best when resources are thought of as things that can be applied to nouns such as a person's birthday or address.
Trying to force a REST API to function without resources is detrimental to it's operation and cleanliness.
